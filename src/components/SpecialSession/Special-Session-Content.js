    description:
      "Theme of the Special Session Internet of things (IoT) is reshaping the cyber world by connecting everything to the internet. From industry to smart industry, from hospital to smart hospital, from cities to smart cities are few applications of IoT. The IoT ecosystem is complex and heterogenous that bring a number of challenges such as decentralization, poor interoperability, privacy and security vulnerabilities susceptible to attacks. The blockchain has emerged as the solution for IoT security due to its numerous advantages such as distributed data storage and immutability. It offers the potential for improving the overall security of the IoT ecosystem. The International Data Corporation predicts that about 20% of all IoT deployments will have some sort of Blockchain services enabled in near future. There is a strong reason to believe that blockchain will lead to the establishment of a new generation of IoT ecosystem. This special track will provide a forum for researchers and industrialists to share recent research results on the convergence of Blockchain and IoT, ranging from overviews, proof-of-concepts case studies, to applications",
